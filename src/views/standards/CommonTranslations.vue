            <p>SproutLoud has a personality and we want to show it to our clients - they are expecting a human on the other line and human beings have unique personalities with different ways of expressing themselves. We don’t want to dehumanize their experience by being so contained to following a strict guideline. Instead, use this information as a guide when developing any communications. One important aspect to keep in mind is we must never compromise our professionalism by humanizing our client’s experience.</p>

              When speaking with our Partners, SproutLoud’s voice is <span class="highlight">helpful, friendly, direct and clear</span>. Our voice is one of expertise tempered with genuine empathy. Our priority is educating Partners about our product so they can cross their marketing duties off of their list and focus on what they really love to do - running their business. We want to inform our Partners without being overbearing. We want to provide them with full transparency without confusing them by providing too detailed information that they do not need to know or cannot do anything with.

              Our tone when communicating with Partners will vary based on the content of our message. However, we are generally <span class="highlight">informal (yet professional), informative and kind</span>. When developing communications to our Partners, consider the experience the Partner has had or is about to have. Are they eager to correct an issue with their account? Are they relieved to no longer have to do anything related to marketing? Are they overwhelmed by the number of decisions they need to make? Once it is clear what the emotional state of the Partner is or will be, you can adjust your tone accordingly.
