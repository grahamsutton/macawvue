            <h2>Variables are the atoms of Macaw â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.</h2>

            <p id="item-1">Our primary action color is <span class="rounded-square bg-primary"></span><code>$color-primary</code>. It is used strategically to call attention to an element, therefore we only use it once on a page. It should only be used for <code>positive, progressive actions</code>. The primary button guides users on what action they should take next, e.g. "Submit", "Yes, I agree".</p>

            <p>The secondary color is <span class="rounded-square bg-secondary"></span><code>$color-secondary</code>. The secondary button supports discovery and exploration but should not be directly associated with a key action. In other words, users won't need to click that button to move forward, but <code>it is an optional action</code>.</p>
          
            <p>The tertiary color is <code>$color-outline</code>, white with a border. It can be used at the discretion of the designer as an alternative to the secondary button. For example Go Back buttons use the tertiary button color.</p>

            <p>The destructive color is <span class="rounded-square bg-danger"></span><code>$color-danger</code>. This is only used when an action is going to delete, remove, or confirm deletion. It assures the user that this action is destructive and can't be undone.</p>
            
            <p>A disabled color should not be used without a clear call to action to the next state. It should be used to reinforce the importance of missing information or as a way of reiterating that the next progression in the customer's journey is unattainable. We also use tooltips when hovering over a disabled button to provide more information on why this is disabled and what they can do to progress. It's important that the user has a clear way to continue.</p>
